# Collatz Conjecture
Famous mathematical problem also known as 3x+1.

This is my algorith coded in Python for trying this problem.

The goal all mathematicians that are trying to disapprove this problem is to get seed that won't end up in loop 4, 2, 1.

## Why use this algorithm?
This algorithm takes advantage of the scenario when temporary integer goes under the value of seed number. When this happens we in fact know that the run failed because there is no number n if 0 < n < seed that doesn't end up in the famous loop of 4, 2, 1.

## My opinion on this problem
I think we shouldn't try to disapprove it because the propability of any integer going under the seed is just so high we can't brute force this. What I'd say is we should focus on calculating the propability of such a number existing first.
